For ease of use, this directory has been subdivided into two parts: 

1. Image processing routines (i.e., superpixel and neural network image segmentation), located in image_processing. These routines have been generalized as the original image data consume hundreds of gigabytes. Original data is available on request, however. 

2. GUI for exploring data and isolating features of interest. The GUI is meant to be used in conjunction with Avizo, which is commerical software.
