To use this code, run the following commands:

1. Create a configuration file:
```
create_config(config_name, image_list, number_pixels, offsets, classes, class_of_interest, original_images, file_prefix, file_ext);
```
where:
  -	config_name is the configuration name
  - image_list refers to a list of training images (a cell array consisting of the full path to each training image)
  - number_pixels is the number of desired superpixels
  - offsets refers to a 1xm matrix that describes which images (above, positive and below, negative) should be included in the training set
  - classes is a cell array of the classes desired
  - class_of_interest is the index of the class of interest (deprecated, can be left blank)
  - original_images is a directory containing all original images
  - file_prefix is the prefix before image counters (e.g., 01CT01 is the prefix to 01CT01######.tif)
  - file_ext is the file extension

2. Next, provide some training data:
```
user_training(configuration_file);
```
where:
  - configuration_file refers to the configuration file produced in step 1. 

3. Now, compile traning stats:
```
compile_training_stats(configuration_file);
```
where:
  - configuration_file refers to the configuration file produced in step 1. 

4. Train the network:
```
net = train_network(configuration_file);
```
where:
  - configuration_file refers to the configuration file produced in step 1. 

5. Process all images:
```
process_all_images(configuration_file);
```
where:
  - configuration_file refers to the configuration file produced in step 1. 

Helper functions include:

- add_field, which adds a field to an existing configuration
```
add_field(configuration, fieldname, type);
```
- search_struct, which searches a structure for a certain field
```
exists = search_struct(full_struct, search_list);
```
